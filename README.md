# `pshtk` : Yet Another PowerShell Toolkit

## Overview

Everyone uses PowerShell just a little bit differently. Here are some snippets I've found useful.

### File Organization

This repository is laid out as if it is _the_ `WindowsPowerShell` folder under `[Environment]::GetFolderPath( 'MyDocuments' )`. While this is how _I_ plan to use it, I strongly recommend you clone it elsewhere. If you're looking at this repository, chances are you've already made substantial investments into your own `$PROFILE` and setup.

## Contributing

For now, this is me capturing my own preferences, so I'm not accepting contributions just yet.
